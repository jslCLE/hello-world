# hello-world
my first exposure to git, all in the name of revamping OCBC's website

"It was my understanding there would be no math."
I don't know where that readme-edit branch I created went.

can't even start the game since it's speaking a foreign language
</br>
Will it read code? <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">YAHOO!</a>

</br>
It does read code. But it's all manual. How is this supposed to be useful? I have yet to discover any clear explanation for why this is preferable for any kind of design work.
